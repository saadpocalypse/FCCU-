The year 2020 had brought significant changes in the world of education. E-learning replaced in-person interaction to continue academic programs, circumventing the spread of Covid-19.  From the very start, enough grievances were raised to warrant dialogue into this matter. Many students and teachers realized that they were ill-equipped to transition into online frameworks. The sudden impetus for change had uncovered a plethora of foundational problems in Pakistan’s education system. Unlike institutions in developed nations, that had been adopting contemporary teaching methodologies, for many years, Pakistan lacked the environment to implement a comparable framework. Pakistani education has historically struggled to keep up with top tier institutions; the new circumstances have only exasperated the disparity. Pakistan is ranked 152 out of 189 countries in the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) ranking.
This situation forced Pakistan to build its e-learning framework from scratch. Several other countries were just as inexperienced in this challenge. E-learning has many aspects that conventional learning doesn’t deeply involve. Thus, it requires a careful execution in tandem with intense scrutiny. It mutates typical methods and curriculum like quizzes, assignments and exams. Hence it is a polarizing prospect that has led to a variety of perceptions from satisfaction to dissatisfaction. This research is thus a data driven effort to analyze the overall opinions of the affected, understand the grievances, and inform the way forward for distance learning in a third world country like Pakistan. 
The first stage of the study dives in for a granular look at a major section of directly affected in Pakistan, i.e., the student body. Data was obtained via a survey to capture the breadth of student satisfaction and overall sentiment towards distance learning. The survey was modeled on a similar study in Jordan, with objectives that intersected with our own, modifying questions in the direction of our research yet keeping enough similarity for comparison. The survey was shared, via social media forums, throughout the student body of Forman Christian College (FCC). The outcomes were compared with those of the Jordanian study to assess the resounding trends beyond national borders. The satisfaction of the other major affected, i.e. teachers, is noted in the literature review, with Pakistani and international perspective. 
The second stage expands to a broader perspective of public opinion. 200,000 tweets, on e-learning, were analyzed to garner a source of general sentiment. 
In the third stage, to assess the pre-existing demand for online learning, we consider the growth and trajectory of online learning by analyzing a dataset which is related to its adoption before the pandemic. 
The overall objective of this paper is to consider all these aspects of online learning as a whole, its inception, growth and, particularly, its current status as an emergency mode of learning during the pandemic. The paper will combine the insights from all analyses to comment on the satisfaction of teachers and students, identify the related grievances and appealing factors, comment on the ethicality and sustainability of e-learning, and to explore how it can become a permanent option in a post pandemic Pakistan. The paper is an effort to provide valuable recommendations to the stakeholders of Forman Christian College to build the College in the image of data sculpted efficacy, improving the e-learning experience and outcomes moving forward.
